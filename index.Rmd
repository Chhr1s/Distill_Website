I'm Christopher Loan, a PhD student at the UO's **Quantitative Research Methods in Education** program.\n

***

I primarily consider myself a methodologist, exploring applications of **structural equation modeling, multilevel-modeling, machine learning, data visualization, & their intersections**.\n

I've applied these methods in **Prevention Science, Psychology, & Education** contexts, with my theoretical interests lying at these fields' boundaries. I use `R` every chance I get — [including making this website with `distill`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) — but dabble in `Python`, as well.

# When I'm not on my laptop, you can find me:

`r fa("circle", fill = "steelblue")` disc golfing,

`r fa("dog", fill = "steelblue")` walking my dog,

`r fa("snowboarding", fill = "steelblue")` skateboarding,

`r fa("golf-ball", fill = "steelblue")` *trying* to play golf,

`r fa("mountain", fill = "steelblue")` rock climbing,

# Projects coming soon

Lately, my interests have pulled me towards deep learning, computer vision, and network analysis. So keep an eye out for new blog posts on these coming soon.
