I use R every chance I get — including making this website with distill — but dabble in Python, as well.\nWhen I’m not on my laptop, you can find me:\n disc golfing,\n walking my dog,\n skateboarding,\ntrying to play golf,\n rock climbing,\nProjects coming soon\nLately, my interests have pulled me towards deep learning, computer vision, and network analysis. So keep an eye out for new blog posts on these coming soon.\n\n\n\n",
